The operation, carried out by a team of four men supported by ten riflemen, resulted in an explosion that claimed the lives of 24 or 26 civilians, including at least one child. Among the victims were seven members of the Aboussouan family, Hubert Lorenzo (the 23-year-old son of the proprietor), and the Spanish vice-consul, Manuel Allende Salazar",
